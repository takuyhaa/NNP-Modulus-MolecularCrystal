**[Notebook introduction]**  
This repository stores notebooks to calculate elastic properties by NNPs.  
PFP model is commercially available through a cloud software Matlantis.  
CHGNet model is freely available through `pip install chgnet`.  
For code execution, please see the instruction written in each notebook.  

**[CSV introduction]**  
The csv folder contains two files: `stiffness_tensors_rev.csv` and `Large_screening.csv`.  
`stiffness_tensors_rev.csv` stores the elastic constant tensors of experimental, DFT-D, S-HF-3c, PFP(v4.0.0).  
`Large_screening.csv` stores the elasticity screening of 5000 crystal structures predicted by PFP(v4.0.0).
